# What is this thing?

This is a attempt of writing an alternative firmware for the LD1125H FMCW radar to extract raw ADC values from the Echo/Bang signal via high-speed UART. 

The hardware reverse engineering part was done in [this article](https://www.dm5tt.de/2024/12/14/ld1125H-reverse-engineering/).

# How to compile

First prepare CMake

```
# mkdir build
# cd build
# cmake ..
```

Then you can build targets

```
# make hello_world
```

which will spit out .elf, .bin and .hex files.


# Build Targets

### hello_world âœ“

This target is a basic test to verify if the clock configuration, RTOS and UART is working correctly.

Connect a UART to PA10 (TX) and PA9 (RX) using a FTDI like FT232H at a baudrate of 4MBaud to see a text being printed out every second.

### remote_control

Todo

### radar_cw

Idea:
 - Set the DAC to a static value
 - Sample the Bang signal at 100kHz
 - Output it to the serial port using an A/B buffer using  UART DMA TX
 - Visualize in Python (Spectrum + FFT)
